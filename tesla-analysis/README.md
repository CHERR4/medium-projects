## Tesla topic extraction and sentiment analysis
For running this project I recommend you to create a virtual environment to install de dependencies. Once you have de venv, you can run `python install -r requirements.txt` to install them.

If you want to replicate the actual notebook you only have to run all cells.

If you want to do the same analysis with other words, you have to insert you twitter credentials, set the words and change the `API_GET_TWEETS = True`.
